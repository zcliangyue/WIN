# WIN: Variable-View Implicit LIDAR Upsampling Network
This is an official implementation of the paper [WIN: Variable-View Implicit LIDAR Upsampling Network](https://github.com/zcliangyue/WIN), a framework for LiDAR upsampling. WIN decouples conventional interpolation algorithms by synthesizing two novel views (HRV and VRV). WIN introduces view confidence to obtain complementary geometric information from different views.
